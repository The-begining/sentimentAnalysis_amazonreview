Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Producs Review using LSTM and DistilBert model
To make code look cleaner and for easier implementation we have created different notebooks for each model. so one change in one model wont affect the results of other model. 
Intially preprocessing part was being done for each model in every notebook however, due to lack of computation time we did  standard data cleaning and used it for diffrent model accordingly.
Both data set contains same number of data sample as they are the same dataset in diffrent version.
